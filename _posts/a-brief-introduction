I'd like to start with a brief introduction of what i'm trying to do here, and where I am coming from. I have been taking various kinds of notes in a Zettelkasten note taking system for over 8 years now, spanning a wide range of my interests.
This has allowed me to see my ideas and knowledge change over time, and to revisit the same concepts with fresh eyes. Some describe the history of philosophy as a grand conversation across time, having a Zettelkasten allows you to have a similar conversation across time, but in terms of the progression of your own worldview.

I decided to set up some tags in this blog which broadly align with the kinds of things I expect to explore here. Really, this blog is a space for me to sharpen the concepts and ideas in my Zettlekasten, and also encourage me to use it more deeply rather than as a shallow collection of ideas.

Here's a snippet of my Zettelkasten, and an explanation of each tag in the blog:

**Epistemology**
For exploration of the way people form ideas and share them - will be pragmatically oriented and based on the use of ideas rather than ideal theoretic.

**Esoterica**
Exploration of wild shit, Crystal healing, meditation, crystal ball gazing, energy healing

**Gnosis**
Spirituality and religion via my pragmatic, jamesian (experience oriented) and mystical orientation

**Phil**
General philosophical exploration with a ludic orientation - playing with ideas.

**Law**
Exploration of Law, usually from a moral or principled perspective.

**World**
Discussion of things happening in the world, often tied to another subject.

**Health**
Talking about health topics.

**Craft**
Wood and gem craft, and anything else that tickles my fancy on the creative side, e.g., basic soapmaking.

**Poems**
Poems, if i'm brave enough.

That should give you an idea of what to expect.
